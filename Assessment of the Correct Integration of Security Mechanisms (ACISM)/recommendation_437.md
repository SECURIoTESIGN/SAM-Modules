# Hardware Overheating

Thermal side effects exist in hardware, electrical circuits, and semiconductor silicon, in which some of the energy absorbed by the device is dissipated as heat, increasing the device's temperature. In CMOS circuits, the leakage current increases with temperature, resulting in positive feedback that can cause thermal runaway and permanently harm the system.

Any device that lacks thermal sensors, sufficient platform cooling, or thermal insulation is vulnerable to attacks by malicious software that may purposefully operate the device in overheating modes. As a denial of service (DoS) or permanent denial of service (PDoS) attack, this can be used.

# Manually 

Acordding to Intel the symptoms of a overheating device are:
* System boots up but shuts down automatically after a short period of time.
* Reported CPU operating frequency is less than expected. 
* Evidence of CPU throttling. 
* General slowness of system.
* CPU/system fan noise is excessive.

To monitor the device temperature it can be used a monitor of cpu temperature such as: AIDA64 Extreme or Paessler CPU Temperature-Monitoring.
